## Format

Standard peer review at Episteme Health journals is:

1. Single-blind - the author's identity is known to the reviewer
2. Optionally signed - reviewers are anonymous but may sign their reviews
3. Public summary - reviewers write a summary of their review for publication but the bulk of their review remains confidential

Standard peer review requires consultation with at least two appropriately qualified reviewers or at least one reviewer if external reviews can be transferred.

Editorials, Professional Perspectives, and Correspondence articles are exempt from peer review and reviewer qualification requirements. However, editors may still solicit reviews for these submissions.

## Double-Blind Review

We use double-blind review in specific circumstances to manage conflicts of interest and bias. Double-blind review is required when:

1. One or more authors are officers or members of the committee of management of Episteme Health Inc.
2. One or more authors have senior editorial roles with the journal, such as managing editor or editor-in-chief

Additionally, authors may request double-blind review if they have concerns about their manuscript being unfairly treated by reviewers.

It is up to authors to remove identifying information from manuscripts submitted for double-blind review including:

* Names and affiliations in the body of the text
* Identifying phrases (e.g. "As we have previously shown...")
* Document metadata or file properties
* Identifying content or metadata in datasets (some services provide anonymous links for datasets)

Reviewers of double-blind manuscripts are asked not to search for preprints that would identify the authors.

## Qualifications

Reviewers must have a relevant PhD or an equivalent track record (at least 3 relevant publications in reputable scientific journals). Reviewers must be in good standing in the academic community with no history of scientific or general misconduct.

A PhD or publication track record is not required for reviewers of Editorials and Professional Perspective articles or for specialist reviews related to compliance with reporting guidelines or references and citations.

## Collaborative Review

Reviewers who do not have a PhD or publication track record may review papers in collaboration with an author who is qualified. For example, a senior PhD student may review papers with their supervisor in order to gain experience with the peer review process. If reviewing a paper collaboratively, please advise the editor so that an acknowledgement email can be sent to the student.

Authors wishing to publish their preprints with the journal may use a collaborative journal club review process, where their preprint is assessed by journal club teams on the [PREreview](https://www.prereview.org/) platform. This may partially replace individual peer reviewers at the editor's discretion.

## Specialist Review

Editors may invite additional reviewers to comment on specific parts of a manuscript, such as a methodology, statistics, compliance with reporting guidelines, or quality of references and ciations. Reviewers may recommend that an editor invite a specialist reviewer at any point by contacting the editor.

## Open Peer Review

We believe that the peer review process is primarily to assist editors in making decisions and authors in improving their papers. For this reason, we ask reviewers to write a short public summary of their review to assist readers in understanding the importance and limitations of a particular paper. These public review summaries, along with the reviewer's identity (if signed), are published along with the paper.

The full peer review report, the editorial decision letter, previous versions, and reviewer identities (if unsigned) all remain confidential. Manuscripts are not made available for public commenting prior to publication.

## Peer Review Transfer

Where authors are able to transfer peer reviews, editors may accept papers after consulting with one additional reviewer. Transferred reviews must be subject to equivalent ethical standards and the identity of the reviewers must be known to editor handling the manuscript. Editors are not obliged to accept transferred reviewer comments. Currently, Episteme Health accepts peer reviews transferred from [Peer Community In](https://peercommunityin.org/).
