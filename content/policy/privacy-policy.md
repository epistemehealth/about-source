## What We Collect

Episteme Health Inc. collects personal information in three ways:

1. Directly from you (e.g. if you register with us)

2. From other users or publicly available databases (e.g. when you are nominated as a reviewer)

3. From your computer as you browse this website.

## Server Logs, Web Analytics, and Cookies

We have configured our journal management software to collect minimal personal information for the purpose of generating usage statistics. These analytics plugins collect minimal personal information and anonymise your personal information.

Our server also collects identifying personal information, including your IP address and user agent automatically. This information is only available to the server admin and is only used for security purposes. Server logs are retained for approximately 1 month.

Cookies are only used to identify your computer for the purposes of maintaining a login if you are a registered user or for maintaining your opt-out preference for our journals' usage statistics plugin. No cookies are installed on your computer if you are only browsing the journal's site.

## Third Party Web Services

We do not display any advertising and have tried to minimise the use of third party services to protect your privacy. However, some parts of our website use third party web services to deliver content and protect our website.

### Google

We use Google reCAPTCHA for spam protection during registration and some parts of our webpage use gstatic to deliver fonts and other website components. If you wish to register, you must consent to Google collecting your personal information in accordance with their policies to determine whether you are likely to be human. The data that Google collects will be governed by their [terms and privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Cloudflare

Our website uses Cloudflare’s content delivery network to serve content and improve the security of our website. Cloudflare collects and processes information about end users in accordance with their [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) and are [GDPR-compliant](https://www.cloudflare.com/gdpr/introduction/).

### MathJax

If you use the eLife LENS reader by clicking on the ‘XML’ link in articles, your browser will use mathjax.org to download JavaScript to display mathematical formulae. For more information, visit [mathjax.org](https://www.mathjax.org/).

### SendGrid

We use SendGrid to provide transactional email services. These are the emails you receive when you create an account, reset your password or submit a paper. We do not use email open tracking or click tracking. However, personal information sent through these emails may be retained for a period of time in accordance with SendGrid's [Privacy](https://sendgrid.com/policies/privacy/) and [Security](https://sendgrid.com/policies/security/) policies.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your personal information for purposes reasonably connected to our management of the journal or the reason your personal information was provided to us. These include:

1. Processing manuscript submissions and reviews

2. Communicating with you about submissions you are involved with

3. Publish your work and connect it with other bibliographic and scholarly databases

4. Fulfill any requests that you have made (e.g. if you have signed up for alerts when there is a new article)

5. Generate non-identifying statistics about the journal's usage (i.e. reads and downloads)

## How We Share Your Information

Readers: We do not share your personal information. We only produce non-identifying aggregate statistics about your usage and provide RSS feeds so that you can anonymously subscribe to updates without needing to register an account or email address.

Authors: If you have published with us, we will share your work online. We may actively share your work with bibliographic indexing services, other scientists, the media, and the general public.

Registered Users: We do not share your details outside of the journal community. Your personal information is only used for the purpose of keeping you informed or for processing manuscripts.

## Your Rights

### Access

If you are a registered user, you can view the personal information we hold about you at any time by logging into your account.

If you are not a registered user, your personal information has been anonymised and we cannot access it.

### Corrections and Updates

If you are a registered user, you can correct or update your personal information at any time by logging into your account.

### Deletion

If you wish to request deletion of your personal information, please contact the journal manager to delete your account.

### Breach Notification

While we have taken care to secure your personal information, in the event of a data breach, you will be notified as soon as we are aware of the breach.

### Data Retention and Jurisdiction

We are obliged to retain some personal information for several years or indefinitely for the purpose of maintaining the integrity of the scholarly record. For example, we will retain workflow information involved in processing an accepted manuscript for 10 years.

We are Australian-based and hosted which means your personal information is stored in Australia. However, some aspects of our website’s operation and publication processes will require your details to be shared with organisations (e.g. Google, digital preservation networks, offsite backups) or individuals (e.g. editors and reviewers) that are based outside of Australia. Wherever possible, we have selected partners and suppliers that are subject to privacy regulations that are as strong, or stronger, than those in place in Australia. For example, we use a cloud storage provider for offsite server backups that is based in Europe and subject to its strict privacy rules.

## Data Security

Your personal information is protected by access controls, encryption, and other technical means. For example, we use password protection for secure parts of our website, SSL for secure content delivery, and server data is encrypted before offsite backup (our cloud storage provider cannot read file names or their contents). We use firewalls to secure server access and have chosen a web hosting provider that provides network-level DDOS protection and ensures physical server security. We endeavour to maintain your data security by keeping our software up to date and have taken care to ensure it is configured to protect your privacy.

### GDPR Compliance

We seek to be compliant with industry standards for data privacy, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provision for “data subject rights” that include (a) breach notification; (b) right of access; (c) the right to be forgotten; (d) data portability; and (e) privacy by design. We try to only retain personal data where there is a public interest - i.e. in the interest of maintaining and protecting the integrity of the scholarly work that we publish.
