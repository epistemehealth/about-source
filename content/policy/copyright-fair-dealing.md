## More than Fair Dealing

Authors retain copyright in their works and license Episteme Health Inc. to be the first publisher of their work. In addition to statutory exemptions from copyright, such as fair dealing, articles are published using free culture licenses. The authors grant anyone obtaining a copy of their work a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (CC BY 4.0), [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) (CC BY-SA 4.0). We can also accommodate requests for the [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (CC0 1.0), for example, if required by their funder or employer. Article metadata is published under a [CC0 Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), ensuring Plan S compliance. 

The [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) licenses both satisfy the [*Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities*](https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration) criteria for an open access work:

> The author(s) and right holder(s) of such contributions grant(s) to all users a free, irrevocable, worldwide, right of access to, and a license to copy, use, distribute, transmit and display the work publicly and to make and distribute derivative works, in any digital medium for any responsible purpose, subject to proper attribution of authorship (community standards, will continue to provide the mechanism for enforcement of proper attribution and responsible use of the published work, as they do now), as well as the right to make small numbers of printed copies for their personal use.

Authors retain unrestricted copyright in their work. No rights are licensed exclusively to Episteme Health, so authors can make any use of their work that they like at any time.

   3.1 If the authors request another license due to funder or employer requirements, that license must provide for reuse rights that are greater than those that would be available under fair dealing under Australian copyright law.

If the authors cannot be contacted for more than three weeks, then their license to publish allows the publisher to grant additional permissions. Fees may apply.
